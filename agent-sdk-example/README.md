# Agent SDK Example

This example shows a very simple usage of the Cobrowse Agent SDK without any UI integration.

See the full docs at https://docs.cobrowse.io/agent-side-integrations/agent-sdk.

# Checkout the code
```sh
git clone git@github.com:cobrowseio/cobrowse-agent-sdk-examples.git
cd cobrowse-agent-sdk-examples/agent-sdk-example
```

# Run the example

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8123/`. In the JS console you should see a 6 digit code has been created and printed out.
